# &nbsp;          Project Statement: ***DNA Sequence Analyzer***

#### &nbsp;                            (An Interdisciplinary Project) 

### &nbsp;1. Problem Statement

###### &nbsp;     Genetics researchers and biology students often face challenges in manually analyzing DNA sequences. Calculating metrics like GC  content, finding complementary(Base pair) strands and manually searching for patterns is time consuming and also prone to human error. Furthermore, visualizing how random mutations affect a sequence in real-time is difficult without computational tools. 

###### This project solves these issues by automating the analysis process and providing a simulation environment for DNA mutations.

###### 

### &nbsp;2. Scope of the Project

###### &nbsp;     The DNA Sequence Analyzer is a CLI-based application designed to process raw genetic data.

###### Input: The system accepts \& validate DNA sequences (A, T, C, G) from the user.

###### Processing: It performs statistical analysis, transcription from DNA to RNA, Pattern Finding and Probability based mutation simulations based on user-defined   parameters.

###### Output: The system generates detailed reports, sequence comparisons, and statistical summaries in the console.

###### 

### &nbsp;3. Target Users

###### &nbsp;     -Programming/CS Nerds: To play with the tool \& Explore the world of genetics.

###### &nbsp;     -Biology Students: To practice and verify genetic calculations.

###### &nbsp;     -Bioinformatics Beginners: To understand string manipulation in a biological context.

###### &nbsp;     -Researchers: For quick, lightweight sequence analysis and mutation testing.



### &nbsp;4. High-Level Features

###### &nbsp;     -Input Validation: strict checking mechanism to ensure only valid nucleotides (A, T, C, G) are processed.     

###### &nbsp;     -Statistical Analysis: Automatic calculation of Sequence Length, GC Content percentage, and AT/GC Ratios.

###### &nbsp;     -Biological Translation: Instant generation of RNA Transcripts and Complementary DNA strands.

###### &nbsp;     -Mutation Simulator: A probability-based engine that allows users to introduce mutations (by percentage or probability) and view the results side-by-side.

###### &nbsp;     -Pattern Recognition: Tools to identify specific sequences(like AT,GTA,AG,CGC,etc.) and palindromic sequences within the strand.
