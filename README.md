## &nbsp; *DNA Sequence Analyzer*



* ### &nbsp;**Description**

##### The DNA Sequence Analyzer is a Python-based **bioinformatics tool** designed to help students and researchers analyze genetic sequences and simulate genetic    mutations using Python. It allows users to validate DNA strings, calculate detailed statistics like GC content, find patterns, and simulate genetic mutations. The program uses Python's string manipulation capabilities to perform biological calculations instantly, replacing the need for manual errors.

* ### &nbsp;**Algorithm**

###### 1\. Start the program.

###### 2\. Display the Main Menu (1.Analyze your DNA Sequence,2.Pattern Search Tool,3.Mutation Percentage,4.Palindrome sequence Finder,5.Exit)                               

###### 3\. If ***Analyze your DNA Sequence*** is selected:

###### &nbsp;  - Input DNA sequence.

###### &nbsp;  - Input Mutation Percentage (How much you want to mutate)

###### &nbsp;  - Validate input (Check for A, T, C, G).

###### &nbsp;  - Calculate GC Content, Complementary Strand, and RNA Transcript with an addition of additional Mutation details, stats \& analysis.

###### 4\. If ***Pattern Search Tool*** is selected:

###### &nbsp;  - Input DNA sequence to search in

###### &nbsp;  - Input pattern to search for ( For example: GT)

###### &nbsp;  - Calculates How many times that pattern occurs and at what position.

###### 5\. If ***Mutation Percentage*** is selected:

###### &nbsp;  - Input DNA sequence

###### &nbsp;  - Choose one of the options

&nbsp;      Mutation Options:

&nbsp;      1. Specify exact percentage of bases to mutate

&nbsp;      2. Use probability-based mutation (classic method)

&nbsp;      3. Return to main menu

###### &nbsp;  - Get Mutated DNA strand with position of mutation.

###### 6\. If ***Palindrome sequence Finder*** is selected:

###### &nbsp;  -Input DNA sequence

###### &nbsp;  -Get Output as number of  palindromic sequences with their position and length.

###### 7\. Repeat until the user chooses to exit the program.



* ### &nbsp;**Features**

###### 1\. Sequence Analysis: Calculates Sequence Length, GC Content and AT/GC Ratio.

###### 2\. Transcription: Converts DNA to RNA and finds Complementary strands.

###### 3\. Mutation Simulator: Simulates random genetic mutations based on user percentage.

###### 4\. Pattern Search: Finds specific motifs and Palindromic sequences.

###### 5\. Validation: Ensures only valid DNA characters are processed.

###### 6\. Continuous Loop: Runs until the user explicitly exits.

###### 

* ### **Technologies Used**

###### 1\. Git and GitHub (Version Control)

###### 2\. VSCode (Code Editor)

###### 3\. Python (Programming Language)
